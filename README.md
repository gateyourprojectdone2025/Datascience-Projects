Room Occupancy Detection Using Data Science
Overview

Room Occupancy Detection is a machine learning-based project designed to determine whether a room is currently occupied using environmental sensor data. It optimizes energy usage by automatically managing devices like lights and air conditioning when the room is empty, improving cost efficiency in smart buildings. The model analyzes data such as Temperature, Humidity, CO₂ Levels, and Light Intensity to predict occupancy accurately.
